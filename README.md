Implementation of Christofides Algorithm

A straight-forward implementation of Christofides algorithm
Tried a randomized approach to generate different tours (just so we'll have different candidate solutions). Works mostly (there are some edge cases that needs to be fixed)
Used networkx eulerian path function as of now (for stable answers).
